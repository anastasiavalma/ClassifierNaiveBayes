Sentiment Analysis with Naïve Bayes Classifier using Apache Spark

📌 Overview

This project focuses on big data analysis by implementing a Naïve Bayes classifier using Apache Spark. The main objective is to classify user reviews from Amazon based on sentiment analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

📜 Description

The dataset consists of customer reviews from Amazon, where we preprocess textual data and apply sentiment classification to predict user ratings. The implementation is written in Python and leverages Apache Spark MLlib for scalable machine learning.

🔥 Features

Big Data Processing: Efficient handling of large-scale datasets with Apache Spark.

NLP Techniques: Text preprocessing, tokenization, and feature extraction.

Naïve Bayes Classifier: A supervised learning model to predict user ratings.

Sentiment Analysis: Understanding user opinions through classification.

Scalability: Optimized for execution in a distributed environment.
