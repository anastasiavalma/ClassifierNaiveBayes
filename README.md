# Sentiment Analysis with Na誰ve Bayes Classifier using Apache Spark

##  Overview
This project focuses on big data analysis by implementing a **Na誰ve Bayes classifier** using **Apache Spark**. The main objective is to classify user reviews from **Amazon** based on sentiment analysis and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

##  Description
The dataset consists of customer reviews from Amazon, where we preprocess textual data and apply **sentiment classification** to predict user ratings. The implementation is written in **Python** and leverages **Apache Spark MLlib** for scalable machine learning.

##  Features
- **Big Data Processing**: Efficient handling of large-scale datasets with **Apache Spark**.  
- **NLP Techniques**: Text preprocessing, tokenization, and feature extraction.  
- **Na誰ve Bayes Classifier**: A supervised learning model to predict user ratings.  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding user opinions through classification.  
- **Scalability**: Optimized for execution in a distributed environment.  

##  Technologies Used
- **Apache Spark**
- **Python (PySpark, NLP libraries)**
- **Machine Learning (Na誰ve Bayes Classification)**
- **Jupyter Notebook (for analysis and visualization)**

##  Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Apache Spark
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive exploration)
